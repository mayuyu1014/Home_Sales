# Home_Sales

* design queries to check the average prices of homes under different conditions.

* cache the temporary table and run the same query.

* the runtime is reduced slightly with cached table.

* save the dataframe by a particular column in partition.

* create a new temporary table for the new partitioned data.

* run the same query to check runtime speed.

* not improving too much, the dataset is too small.
